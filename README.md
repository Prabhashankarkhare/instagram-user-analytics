# instagram-user-analytics

Project Description:
The goal of this project is to analyze Instagram user data and offer investors and marketing teams insightful information. Finding user patterns, behaviors, and inconsistencies that can enhance engagement, improve marketing tactics, and evaluate platform activity as a whole is the target.

We were able to extract important information on user registration, activity levels, engagement, and possible bot activities by using SQL queries on an Instagram database. In addition to giving investors data-driven figures on platform engagement, the analysis assists marketing teams in increasing user participation.
